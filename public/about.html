<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I believe that great communication starts with understanding people—a skill I’ve honed through years of Montessori teaching and a background in journalism. Currently, I am bridging the gap between my love for education and my passion for media by pursuing a Digital Publishing certificate at SCF.

<p>My journey has taken me from newsrooms at UCF to the yoga mat and the classroom. This diverse background allows me to approach digital creation with a unique lens: one that prioritizes clarity, empathy, and engagement. I am currently transitioning into the remote creative space, where I aim to combine my writing expertise with digital design to tell stories that matter, wherever in the world I may be.</p>

  <h2>Outside of work you'll find me:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Deep in a sci-fi book or hiking trail</li>
    <li>Finding flow on my yoga mat</li>
    <li>Perfecting the art of the Irish Goodbye at social gatherings</li>
  </ul>
